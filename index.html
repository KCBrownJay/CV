        <p>
          Was a former windy tube instructor pre covid in Kansas City. Decided to switch
          careers and begin learning web development. I would like to eventually become
          a front-end developer, and then gradually work up to full-stack. It will take
          a lot of work and grind, but is more than possible. I mean I thought up the
          existence of a snake today... You gotta want it.
